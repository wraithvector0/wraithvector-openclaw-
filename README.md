# WraithVector Governance Plugin for OpenClaw

## Status

Production-ready MVP.  
Actively used to evaluate runtime governance for OpenClaw agents.

![OpenClaw Plugin](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenClaw-plugin-blue)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green)
![EU AI Act](https://img.shields.io/badge/EU%20AI%20Act-compliant-purple)

WraithVector intercepts every tool call **before execution** and enforces security policies.  
Every decision generates **cryptographic audit evidence** for compliance (EU AI Act, DORA).

Works with any OpenClaw agent without modifying your agent code.

## Demo

```
agent : run the command: rm -rf /

WraithVector → BLOCK
Reason:        COMMAND_NOT_ALLOWED
Evidence:      cryptographic hash chain record
PDF:           https://app.wraithvector.com/api/audit/pdf?id=...
```

```
agent : run the command: ls

WraithVector → ALLOW
Reason:        COMMAND_IN_POLICY
Evidence:      cryptographic hash chain record
```

---

## Quick test

After installing, run:

agent : run the command: rm -rf /

If WraithVector is active you should see:

WraithVector → BLOCK

## Threats blocked

• dangerous shell commands (rm -rf, curl | bash)  
• access outside allowed workspace paths  
• malicious prompt injection tool usage  
• compromised ClawHub skills executing unauthorized actions

---

## What it does

Every tool call your OpenClaw agent makes is evaluated by WraithVector **before execution**:

| Hook | What it controls |
|------|-----------------|
| `exec` | Command scope — only allowed commands execute |
| `read` | Path scope — only allowed paths are accessible |
| `write` | *(coming soon)* File write restrictions |
| `web_fetch` | *(coming soon)* Domain allowlist/blocklist |

Every ALLOW and BLOCK decision generates a **cryptographic audit trail** — independently verifiable, EU AI Act and DORA compliant.

---

## Why this matters

> **A Cisco audit (Feb 2026) found that 26% of ClawHub skills contain critical vulnerabilities including data exfiltration and prompt injection.** WraithVector intercepts every tool call before execution and generates cryptographic forensic evidence of every decision.


In February 2026, an OpenClaw agent autonomously created a MoltMatch dating profile without explicit user consent. WraithVector would have:

- **Blocked** the action before execution
- **Generated forensic evidence** of the attempt with a cryptographic hash chain
- **Alerted** the operator via Slack/email in real time

This is not hypothetical. OpenClaw agents execute real actions — shell commands, file reads, web requests — on your machine. Without governance, you have no visibility and no control.

---

## Architecture

```
OpenClaw agent tool call
         ↓
  before_tool_call hook
         ↓
  WraithVector API (policy evaluation)
         ↓
     ALLOW / BLOCK
         ↓
   + cryptographic audit record
   + PDF evidence pack
   + real-time alert (optional)
         ↓
  OpenClaw executes or stops
```

**Fail-closed by default** — if WraithVector is unreachable, actions are blocked to protect your system.

Set `WRAITHVECTOR_FAIL_OPEN=true` to allow actions when offline (development only).

If the governance API is unreachable, the plugin blocks the action locally (fail-closed).  

No audit record is generated because the governance engine was not reached.

---

## Security model

WraithVector enforces governance outside the agent runtime.

OpenClaw executes tools locally, while WraithVector evaluates policy remotely and produces tamper-evident audit evidence.

This separation ensures:

• enforcement cannot be bypassed by the agent  
• decisions are externally auditable  
• policies can be updated without modifying agent code

WraithVector acts as an external governance layer for agent actions.

## Default policy

Out of the box, WraithVector ships with a safe default policy:

```json
{
  "exec": {
    "allowed_roles": ["*"],
    "allowed_commands": ["ls", "pwd", "echo", "cat", "grep"]
  },
  "read": {
    "allowed_roles": ["*"],
    "allowed_paths": ["~/.openclaw/workspace/"]
  }
}
```

Policies are managed in the WraithVector dashboard — no plugin changes required.

## What you get in the audit trail

Every decision generates:

- **Decision record** — tool name, command, decision (ALLOW/BLOCK), reason, timestamp
- **Cryptographic hash chain** — tamper-evident, independently verifiable
- **PDF evidence pack** — ready for compliance audits (EU AI Act Article 12, DORA)
- **Real-time alerts** — Slack and email on high-risk events

---

## Manual install (alternative)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace/plugins/wraithvector
curl -o ~/.openclaw/workspace/plugins/wraithvector/index.mjs \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wraithvector0/wraithvector-openclaw/main/index.mjs
curl -o ~/.openclaw/workspace/plugins/wraithvector/openclaw.plugin.json \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wraithvector0/wraithvector-openclaw/main/openclaw.plugin.json
openclaw gateway restart
```
